# Sample Cadnano Design Files

This directory contains many sample files. Some of these are taken from exterior sources. For more details about licenses, please see the [NOTICES.md](../../NOTICES.md) file. 

This readme contains some basic notes about the files and where they come from.

Douglas, et al, Nature 2009
----------

Files: 
```
doublegear.json
icosahedron.json
monolith.json
railedbridge.json
slottedcross.json
Nature09_squarenut_no_joins.json
slottedcross-1.json
slottedcross-2.json

```

These are from the Douglas et al, Nature 2009 paper. Very good basic honeycomb design files, and the last three are modified versions to test / visualize different aspects of the conversion ond viewing process.


Dietz, et al, Science 2009
--------------------------
File: `beachball.json`

This is a great curved structure example.


Rothemund, Paul WK, Nature 2006.
--------------------------------
File: `Rothemund-rect.json`

The rectangle that started it all.


HarvarDNAnos BIOMOD Project
---------------------------
File: `Barrel_cadnano.json`

A good example of a barrel structure.



Various samples created for Nanodesign
--------------------------------------
Files: 
```
fourhelix.json
hc-test-1.json
hc-test-2.json
hc-test-4.json
hc-test-6.json
hc-test-8.json
sq-test-1.json
sq-test-2.json
endcap_issues.json
endcap_issues_with_staples.json
```

These samples test various configurations of honeycomb lattice, square lattices and visualization artifacts, as well as an extremely simple square lattice design.


Autodesk A Logo
---------------
File: `aNANO_3D_7_14_final.json`

This is an extremely large scaffold structure that makes an Autodesk A logo using a 3D square lattice design. Scaffold is ~24kb. Useful for testing very large structures.
