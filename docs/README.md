Documentation
=============

Most of the entries in this directory were generated via sphinx-quickstart. Relevant files for editing:

`conf.py`: the generated configuration for the sphinx documentation, may be modified if we start changing settings, etc.
`index.rst`: the main source file for the documentation.

Probably shouldn't edit:
`Makefile`: has the basic commands for building the docs. E.g. for an html version, 'make html' will create it.
`make.bat`: same as Makefile, for Windows users.
