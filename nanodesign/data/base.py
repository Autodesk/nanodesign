"""
This module is used to store data for a DNA base. 

A list of DnaBase objects, stored in the DnaStructure object, is used to define the connectivity (topology) 
of a DNA structure: bases that are adjacent along a single DNA helix and which base they are paired with (if any).

        Attributes:
            across (VisBase): The base's Watson-Crick neighbor.
            coordinates ((3x1 numpy float arrayList[Float]): The base helix axis coordinates.
            domain (int): The domain ID the base is in.
            down (VisBase): The base's 3' neighbor.
            h (int): The ID of the helix the base is in. 
            id (int): The base ID.
            is_scaf (bool): If True then this base is in a scaffold strand. 
            num_insertions (int): The number of insertions at this base.
            nt_coords ((3x1 numpy float arrayList[Float]): The base nucleotide coordinates.

            p (int): The helix position of the base.
            seq (string): A one character string representing the base sequence nucleotide. 
            num_deletions (int): The number of deletions at this base.
            strand (int): The strand ID the base is in.
            up (VisBase): The base's 5' neighbor.

        The base coordinates and reference frame are references to elements of arrays stored in
