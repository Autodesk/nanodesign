This file exists to recognize the contributors to the project and the work that has gone into it. 

Listing (alphabetical):

* Peter Jones, [Life Sciences Group, Autodesk Research](https://lifesciences.autodesk.com)
  Peter handles the automated build process, and has added some jenkins configurations to help use this in an automated way.
* Dave Parker, [Life Sciences Group, Autodesk Research](https://lifesciences.autodesk.com)
  Dave's hand is found in every part of the current package, and it wouldn't have been possibly without him. As of this writing, most of the code here was written by him.
* Joseph Schaeffer, [Life Sciences Group, Autodesk Research](https://lifesciences.autodesk.com)
  Joseph is the primary maintainer for this project, and helped lay out how it should be built. Blame them for the organization and lack of documentation. 
* Jean-Philippe Sobczak, [Tilibit Nanosystems](https://www.tilibit.com/)
  Jean-Philippe developed the [`stapler`](scripts/stapler.py) script, using expertise from Tilibit Nanosystems in designing good stapler sets.
